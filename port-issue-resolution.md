# Port Issue Resolution

## 🚨 **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

**Problem:** User is accessing the application on port 3000, but the development server is running on port 3001
**Result:** CSRF token validation errors because they're hitting a different server instance

---

## 🔧 **SOLUTION**

### **Current Server Status:**
- ✅ **Port 3001:** Current development server (with all our fixes)
- ❌ **Port 3000:** Old server instance or different process

### **To Fix the CSRF Issue:**

1. **Access the correct URL:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3001/admin/settings
   ```
   
2. **NOT:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/admin/settings  ❌
   ```

---

## 📊 **VERIFICATION**

### **Port 3000 (Wrong):**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/admin/settings"
# Response: {"error":"Unauthorized"}
```

### **Port 3001 (Correct):**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3001/api/admin/settings"
# Response: Proper settings data (with authentication)
```

---

## 🎯 **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Close the browser tab** with port 3000
2. **Open new tab** and navigate to `http://localhost:3001/admin/settings`
3. **Login again** if needed
4. **Test the notification actions** - they should now work correctly

---

## ✅ **EXPECTED RESULT**

Once accessing the correct port (3001):
- ✅ Settings page loads without CSRF errors
- ✅ Notification actions work correctly
- ✅ All admin functions work properly
- ✅ CSRF tokens are handled correctly

---

## 🔍 **WHY THIS HAPPENED**

The terminal shows:
```
⚠ Port 3000 is in use by process 2776, using available port 3001 instead.
```

This means:
- Port 3000 was already occupied by another process
- Next.js automatically switched to port 3001
- User was still accessing the old port 3000
- The old server doesn't have our CSRF fixes

**Solution: Use port 3001!** 🚀
