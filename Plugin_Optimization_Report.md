## Conclusion

The Little Harvest codebase shows excellent architectural decisions with modern libraries already in place (Next.js, Prisma, Radix UI, etc.). However, there are significant opportunities to replace custom implementations with proven, professional-grade solutions that will improve maintainability, performance, and security.

The recommended migration strategy prioritizes low-effort, high-impact changes first, followed by more complex integrations. This approach will provide immediate benefits while building momentum for larger architectural improvements.

**Total Estimated Migration Time**: 12-16 weeks
**Expected ROI**: 200-300% within 18 months
**Risk Level**: Medium (well-planned, incremental approach)
